## Auth Center
This is my Auth Center developed using **Next.js 14** and **Next-auth v5 (Auth.js)**, which provides the main functionalities of credential login and logging in with **OAuth** providers (currently supported oAuth providers: Google, Github). Other functionalities like Two-factor verification (2FA), Email verification, Access control, User settings, etc are also provided.

In terms of techs, the whole project was built using **Next.js 14** with **TypeScript**, where I used **PostgreSQL** on the cloud as the database and **Prisma** as the ORM modeling tool for the database. The backend server logics were developed using **Next.js server actions** and the front-end was designed with **React.js**, **ShadcnUI**, and **TailWind CSS**. **Next-auth v5 (Auth.js)** was used to develop the functionality of logging in with third-party OAuth providers.

The project is deployed on **Vercel**, here is a [live demo](https://auth.liuzhelucas.com/).
